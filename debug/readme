All-in-one files for testing HTML/js/WebGPU:

test.html - red triangle coordinates directly in shader, no buffers
test_buffers.html - drive the coordinated from js

These were used to test that we show something on the screen.
 -> we did not store the uniforms correctly in the buffer
 -> clip space was OpenGL -1,1 instead of WebGPU/Vulkan 0,1
